        <br>
        <h2 class="h2">E-mail program</h2>
        <p class="stepsemail">
            To send and receive e-mail messages, you can use an e-mail program, also known as an e-mail client, such as
            Microsoft Outlook or Mozilla Thunderbird. When using an e-mail client, a server that stores and delivers
            your messages is used. This server is often hosted by your ISP but can be another Internet company. An
            e-mail client needs to connect to a server to download new e-mail, whereas e-mail stored online is always
            available to any Internet-connected device. For more information about cloud e-mail service, see the
            difference between webmail and an e-mail client, below.</p>

Examples include Hotmail (now Outlook.com), Gmail, and Yahoo Mail. Many online e-mail services, including the ones we mentioned, are free or have a free account option.</p>
