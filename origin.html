            <div class="history"> <b class="delivery" >  Ray Tomlinson </b> is credited as the inventor of networked email; in 1971, he developed the
                first system able to send mail between users on different hosts across the ARPANET, using the @ sign to link
                the user name with a destination server. By the mid-1970s, this was the form recognized as email.
                
                Meanwhile in 1978, a 14-year-old boy, Shiva Ayyadurai began his work on an email system for the University
                of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.

                <div class="history">For a time in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it seemed likely that either a proprietary commercial system or the X. 400 email system, part of the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP), would predominate. However, once the final restrictions on carrying commercial traffic over the Internet ended in 1995, a combination of factors made the current Internet suite of SMTP, POP3 and IMAP email protocols the standard. </div>
